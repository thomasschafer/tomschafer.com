    Hi, I'm Tom Schafer. I'm a software engineer who enjoys building performant systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Professionally I have experience across the stack using languages including TypeScript, Go, Python and Ruby,
    building and operating both distributed and monolithic systems, and running them on Kubernetes across various cloud
    platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my spare time I like playing around with Haskell. When I'm not coding you'll most likely find me cycling or
    reading: a few of my favourite books are Doing Good Better by William MacAskill, Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark and The
    Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins.
