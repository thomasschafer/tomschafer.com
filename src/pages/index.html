    Hi, I'm Tom Schafer. I'm a software engineer who enjoys building performant systems, and working with
    statically typed languages such as Haskell and Rust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Professionally I have experience across the stack using languages including TypeScript, Go, Python and Ruby,
    building and operating distributed (and monolithic) systems running on Kubernetes across cloud
    platforms including AWS and GCP.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not coding you'll most likely find me cycling or reading: a few of my favourite books are Doing Good
    Better by William MacAskill, Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark and The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins.
